This project is a generic data structures library implemented in C. It provides efficient and reusable
implementations of common data structures, starting with a Singly Linked List. The goal is to offer a
clean and easy-to-use . Developers can use these data structures into their c-based projects without worrying about
the internal details I structured the project into separate folders for declarations (include),
implementations (src), compiled libraries (lib), and test cases (testcases) to keep things organized
and professional
